      "Despite whatever other folks or publications may tout in their EXPO recaps that inundated LinkedIn this past week, there‚Äôs no functional beverage or palo santo brew that can help me recover from these past few weeks, not to mention the SVB fiasco that had me scrambling for an alternative bank account while heading out to Austin. Hope you missed me though‚Äîget those thumbs warmed up, they about to get a good cardio while scrolling through this issue‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a LONG one. Emerging out of our SnaxWest tour in LA and Austin to ‚Äútrend reports‚Äù that talk about ‚Äúplant-based everything‚Äù and ‚Äúmushroom mania‚Äù as if this wasn‚Äôt obvious 3 years ago‚Äîbut I digress, it seems that we have once again become content with having people regurgitate the obvious to us with mouths wide open like baby birds.\n",
      "Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam\n",
      "And admit that the functional waters have grown\n",
      "‚ÄîBob Dylan, former snaxboi\n",
      "And no you shall not find a recap like that here ‚Äîwe‚Äôve stated our case last year that EXPO is indeed NOT the place to ‚Äúspot‚Äù trends, imagine asking emerging brands already strapped for cash to drop $20k on a basic booth or having to shill $1.3k on tickets to‚Ä¶network? Last year we wrote in depth about this dynamic‚Äîdespite it being three years since the pandemic broke out, and considering the current state of the economy, somehow things remain the same for emerging brands, expensive expos and booths as gatekeeping, while institutions profit enormously not only from attendees, but from data collected afterwards. Yet we are expected to continue this charade every year‚Äîwithout considering, how can things be better?\n",
      "Move over, yeah, don't do it over (yeah yeah yeah)\n",

      "‚ÄîMove Over, Spice Girls\n",
      "Snaxshot‚Äôs only been around since 2020, but within every atom of our foundation, community and comraderie abound, the more we entrenched ourselves in the ins and outs of this space, the more we realized just how unfair the existing dynamics are for most emerging brands, and we‚Äôve used our platform and limited resources to level the existing playing field for them. From hosting snax seances in New York, to cult indoctrinations in San Francisco, to hosting our first EXPO event last year, where we partnered with some incredible people to imagine what it would look like if we created a more accessible space for brands to showcase ‚Äîthe results where incredible, we had over 40 brands from around 5 countries, including many pre-launch goodies, where we brought community to support show up for each other.\n",
      "Though some VC backed brands noted that they‚Äôve seen return of their Expo investments, which averages 20% of a brand‚Äôs annual revenue, that‚Äôs not the norm for the majority of food and beverage founders.\n",
      "In keeping this tradition, this year, I decided to take a chance in widening the vision by reaching out to friends like John Craven from BevNet and new found ones like Alex and Megan from HERE studio. Together we planned ‚ÄúBrave New Snax World‚Äù to make the case for a new kind of event‚Äîlike an ‚Äúun-conference‚Äù ‚Äîthis year we doubled the number of brands invited, we had brands as far as Singapore and Australia represented, as well as France, and Spain ‚Äîwe had founders join us from Mexico, Canada and UK, as well as 300 other snaxers! When community shows up for its own ‚Äîthe results are amazing, I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for all the brands who participated, for all the founders who showed up from far and near, to all the investors and retail partners who came to scout brands, and of course to our amazing hosts for donating their time, team and space, and to BevNet for sponsoring the night‚Äîthanks to all of the above, we were able to create an accessible, free and fun event for and by the community, I am merely an adhesive to help glue this all together.\n",

       "'A newsletter on upcoming food and beverage trends that offers a curation of brands and aesthetics written by Andrea Hern√°ndez.\\nSnaxshot is ad-free as we are community funded, if you enjoy our content, contribute here. ü§ó\\nüîÆ Peek into the future:\\nBeauty is in the eye of the snaxboi\\nOn origins of packaging\\nAndy Warhol‚Äôs CPG influence\\nRebrands as the new launch\\nAround the world in Pantry Kiths\\nOracular Spectacular and Trendspotting\\nSpoonful of News\\nCome on in, the water‚Äôs warm, you know you want to!\\nSubscribed\\nSitting Pretty, Oh So Pretty\\nIn defense of aestheticism, our brains literally crave beauty. Studies have shown that ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù literally triggers a part of our cerebellum that controls our hand movement, making us literally want to reach out for beautiful things. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and it involves everything from art, mates or that adaptogenic milk cardboard at your local curated grocer, it is no surprise then, to see the current state of F&B, where every item is seeking to either Trojan-horse us with pretty packaging, or undergoing upgrades to continue to appeal and be competitive in saturated markets, as we undergo an industry renaissance.\\nConsider that the last Renaissance saw the rise of food as a popular subject in in still life paintings, and at a time where we are still undergoing the affects of a pandemic, it comes to no surprise that relaxed renaissance is trending, as well as a rise in synaesthetic experiences and tablescapism post 2020. I‚Äôve been documenting this behavior since SXS began, our cult literally revolves around worshipping sexy pantry items and sultry snack, consider our issue ‚ÄúHorny, horny people‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmerican Snaxboi‚Äù wherein I trace back this new found love for ‚Äúaesthetics‚Äù to being the Instagram generation, Millennials trying to find deeper connection with what nurtures them as well as trying to undo the ‚Äúchaotic, punk‚Äù aesthetics most of them grew up with in the 90s.\\nOur parents used to not care about the ‚Äúaesthetics‚Äù or the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of ketchup much more than the utility around it, nor did they carry around cereal boxes as a ‚Äúfashion item‚Äù (something that‚Äôs gain popularity in South Korea) even if most of them grew up as yuppies, the vibe in F&B back then was so ‚Äúanti‚Äù fluff and more utility based that Lacroix literally became a hit by positioning themselves as the ‚Äúanti Perrier‚Äù ‚Äîyet the children of this generation find themselves wanting to signal with their organic Dark Horse fermented ketchups displayed neatly on their bare kitchen shelves, posting it on tiny grids where we let others know, we are snaxbois who are in the ‚Äúknow‚Äù ‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt happen all at once.\\nThe 2010s saw Millennials come of age, since then we‚Äôve engaged in a perpetual discovery mode trying to find replacements for our food and beverage basics, that better fit our criteria and expectations. At first, the need was unfulfilled, this led to companies like Sir Kensington‚Äôs and Halo Top to become a threat to almost 100 year old, behemoth, legacy brands by catering to this demographic, that would a decade later become the largest consumer cohort. Documented this movement on ‚ÄúSeasoned Greetings‚Äù on the revolution in pantry items like condiments, olive oil and hot sauces, as well as in ‚ÄúScoop there it is‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in your fridge?‚Äù unpacking the changes happening inside our freezers, whether it‚Äôs adaptogenic ice cream or cassava, plant based pizza bites.\\nWant to chat more snax?Join our Discord.\\nThe success of these companies led to an influx of venture money being poured into these companies, as competition grows, so does the need to stand out amongst a sea of sameness, not just with utility (fulfilling the actual need) but it became the norm for these companies to spend thousands if not hundreds of thousands in marketing, PR and design to produce trendy packaging that would appeal to Millennials and GenZ alike, wether it was capturing them through social ads, activations or generating hilarious UGC on TikTok. UGC (user generated content) runs a muck inside these platforms, our generations wanting to signal whether through a fridge shot or a shelfie, creating a hot item pays off amongst a generation who speaks aesthetics first, (hello influencers) food and beverage have officially become external signalers in the same way fashion items have, foodie culture and food porn also contributed to increase in packaging porn.\\nTimeline of Packaging\\n‚ÄîAncient China is credited for inventing flexible packaging due to their innovations in developing paper. Back then they used mulberry bark to wrap foods and in later centuries, after perfecting paper-making techniques, paper began to be used for packaging items such as medicine and parcels of tea.\\n‚ÄîIn Ancient Egypt, glass was costly and regarded as a precious stone typically reserved for royalty. This obsession with glass eventually lead Egyptians to discover glass blowing tech of which could mold glass into containers for food and water storage.\\n‚ÄîThe middle ages saw a rise in popularity in using wooden barrels and wood boxes as storage and transportation devices. Barrels were typically used for traveling across oceans to store items such as rum, dried food, and fresh water.\\n‚ÄîNicolas Appert, also known as the father of canning, invented a method to preserve food for an extended period of time by boiling then sealing food in airtight glass containers, a method still used to this day!\\n‚ÄîIn 1810, Peter Durand, an Englishman, patented the use of tin-coated iron cans instead of bottles to preserve food. Over the next 20 years, tin would become one of the most popular packaging materials for packaging things like cookies and tobacco.\\n‚ÄîThough cardboard itself had been invented several hundred years earlier in China, the cardboard box wasn‚Äôt created until 1817 by Sir Malcolm Thornhill, these boxes weren‚Äôt corrugated yet, that wouldn‚Äôt be invented until 1871. Cardboard boxes were popular among silk manufacturers to transport moths and eggs from Japan to Europe.\\n‚ÄîSeveral years after the first commercial paper bags were created in 1844, Francis Wolle invented a machine capable of mass-producing paper bags.\\n‚ÄîRobert Gair, a Brooklyn printer developed the first carton by accident! Gair was the owner of a paper bag company. One day, one of Gair‚Äôs machines malfunctioned by slicing through (rather than creasing) a stack of paper bags. It was then that Gair realized that cutting and creasing cartons in one operation could make prefabricated cartons.\\n‚ÄîThe Kellogg brothers, known for the invention of Corn Flake cereal in 1877, began using cardboard to distribute and market their cereal as early as 1906, otherwise known as the first cereal box.\\nAndy Warhol as the OG Snaxboi\\nNone other was able to set the foundations of packaging as external signaling, or as art form than the incomparable Andy Warhol, who‚Äôs interest in gifting is what led him to become obsessed with ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù in norm settings. Pop art became a movement that used humor and irony to comment on mass production and how consumerism had come to dominate much of American life and culture, unlike prior movements that focused on the creative process, this one tried to eliminate traces of it , like brush strokes‚Äîso that artwork emulated an almost mechanical, mass-produced feel. Warhol‚Äôs experience working in commercial accounts, working with the likes of Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Dior and Tiffany‚Äôs gave him this exact POV.\\n** Fun fact, Lunchables were designed to look like a gift because it was a way to ease moms from feeling guilty for not preparing their kids meals and send them off with pre-made snacks instead**\\nAt first, his exposition of the 32 Campbell soup cans failed to attract interest, instead criticism as most audiences were not familiar with this young art movement in the early 60s, by the way, his appeal to this particular brand came from him growing up on their soups, focusing on a common, everyday product. By the mid 60s however, society was starting to warm up to the idea of pop art, and in 1964, Warhol put on the infamous exhibition, The American Supermarket in collaboration with other artists from the same movement. Held at the Bianchini Gallery in New York, the show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc. were created by six prominent pop artists of the time including the controversial (and like-minded) Billy Apple, Mary Inman, and Robert Watts. It was such a success, that in just 2 years, his paintings each were selling for $1,500 each.\\nWant to chat more snax?Join our Discord.\\nAndy Warhol was the original snaxboi, understanding that pantry items need to pop out at shelves, they want to be seen, allowing for these common products to be considered as art form even as a consumer packaged good. His legacy has led this movement, wherein art, food, lifestyle and fashion intersect. Consider that the London Design Museum created an entire grocery store that featured common grocery items with designs from several artists, the market itself held that very ‚Äúpop art‚Äù 60s look, Pop Up Grocer holds a similar look, creating an experiential environment that feels similar to the 1964 exhibition, not to mention Superette‚Äôs incredible supermarket store, that holds cannabis items that are packaged to look like they belong in regular pantry shelves. But perhaps, the ultimate nod to the Warhol genius, comes from Omega Mart, an exhibition in Vegas from Meow Wolf, a parody of an average grocery stores, where you can actually purchase their spoof items.\\nOh to be a pantry item through a looking glass \\nstaring out at your produce waiting to be picked up too.  \\n                                                                 ‚ÄîAndrea Hern√°ndez \\nIt‚Äôs the Aesthetics, Stupid\\n‚ÄîCPG packaging spend continues to rise: 56% of CPG brand owners reported an increase in spending on packaging since 2019 and 65% said they anticipate growing their spending in 2022 and 2023.\\n‚Äî72% of American consumers say that product packaging design influences their purchasing.\\n‚ÄîRebrands are the new launch: 30% of businesses report an increase in revenue after improving product packaging.\\n‚ÄîClassic snaxboi : 40% of American consumers will post photos on social media (UGC) of products with unique branded packaging.\\n‚ÄîPerpetual discovery mode: 52% of consumers have changed product brands because of new packaging design.\\n‚ÄîGenZ and Millennials are spending most of their food budget on groceries accounting for 70% of it.\\n‚ÄîBoth GenZ and Millennials crave a browsing experience and discovery, on average, both generations visit a grocery store three times a week.\\n‚ÄîBrand loyalty amongst both generations is at an all time low, these generations more prone to trying new than known based on price, convenience and criteria.\\nRebrands are the New Launch\\nNow that we‚Äôve established that looks fucking matter, sorry to those who solely believe beauty lays on the inside, at least not in this industry. Let‚Äôs talk about the sudden surge in rebrands, to appeal to modern consumers, fit into pantry kiths, and become coveted items that double as accessories and signalers of cool‚Äîrebrands have become the new launch.\\nSo much so that the rebrand cycle has become increasingly short, whereas before, brands would spend time building their brand equity, patent looks, colors, fonts etc, now it has become a brave new bland world, wherein every item is emulating each other, trying to borrow from established clout in what seems a never ending cycle, spoke about this last year on a Vice interview on ‚ÄúWhy food brands all about the aesthetics now‚Äù ‚Äîshout out to Bettina Makalintal!
